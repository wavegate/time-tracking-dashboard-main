## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid and Flexbox
- JavaScript w/ Fetch API

### What I learned

- First time using Grid
- Using Fetch to load a local .json file

### Continued development

- The script file didn't take long to write but it looks quite messy. I imagine once I get into more complicated states and hooks, etc. I will want to learn React.
